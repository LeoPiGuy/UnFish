# UnFish
An AutoHotkey based Minecraft auto-fishing script

This project was started as a joke, but the script works suprisingly well so I decided to keep it.

## Installation and Setup
First install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm#s11). Then you have a choice of running the script using AutoHotkey, or compiling it into an executable that can be run without AutoHotkey installed.

## Usage

1. Have minecraft open, fishing rod in hand, and stand in front of water (prepared to fish)
2. Run the script (can minimize Minecraft or alt-tab out)
3. Refocus the minecraft window (in full screen) and watch as the system automatically fishes!

> Note: To exit `UnFish`, press escape and it will quit!
